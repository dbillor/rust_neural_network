# Rust Neural Network

This is a simple neural network implementation in Rust.

## Usage

To use this neural network, create a new instance of the `NeuralNetwork` struct and add layers using the `add_layer` method. Train the network using the `train` method, passing in input and target values along with a learning rate.

## Design Decisions

The neural network is designed with a modular approach, separating the functionality of the network, layers, and neurons into distinct structs. The implementation follows Rust's best practices for safety, performance, and code organization.

## Abstract

The neural network is a basic feedforward neural network with backpropagation for training. It is implemented in Rust to showcase the language's capabilities in creating a safe and performant application.

## AI Assistant

This project was created entirely by an AI assistant. The assistant interacted with the user to gather requirements, designed and implemented the neural network, wrote unit tests, created the README file, and pushed the project to GitHub. All code was written and organized following Rust's best practices, and the assistant ensured that the project was safe, performant, and maintainable.
