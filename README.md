# Rust Neural Network

This is a simple neural network implementation in Rust. The project showcases safe, efficient, and maintainable software development principles in Rust.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Build the project using `cargo build`.
3. Run the tests with `cargo test`.

## Architecture

The neural network uses a basic feedforward architecture with an arbitrary number of layers and nodes. The implementation is built using the ndarray crate for matrix manipulation. The network weights are stored in a Vec of Array2 (2-dimensional arrays) from the ndarray crate.

This neural network is a simple demonstration and is not optimized for performance or specific use cases.
